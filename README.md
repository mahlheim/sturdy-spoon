## Description
This is a command line application that dynamically generates a professional README file based on a user's input gathered via the Inquirer package from npmjs.com. This application should streamline the README creation process by ensuring all sections are filled out as necessary and formatted accordingly.

## Installation
Clone the repo, then install Inquirer from npmjs.com to run the application from the command line.

## Usage
Once installation is complete, run 'node index.js' in the command line from the root folder of the application. You will be asked to answer a series of questions. Once all the questions have been answered, you will recieve a 'success' message and your newly generated README will have appeared in the root folder of the application.
